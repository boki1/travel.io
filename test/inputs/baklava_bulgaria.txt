-- I have been a baklava lover my whole life and the next weekend I am planning to do a trip abroad,
-- suggest me a city, close to Bulgaria which is famous for its baklava.

If you are a baklava lover and are planning a trip close to Bulgaria, I recommend visiting Istanbul,
Turkey. Istanbul is a city that is famous for its baklava, which is a sweet and flaky pastry made
with layers of phyllo dough and filled with nuts, honey, and spices. There are many pastry shops
in Istanbul that are renowned for their baklava, such as Karaköy Güllüoğlu and Hafız Mustafa.
These shops have been making baklava for generations, using traditional recipes and techniques.
In addition to baklava, Istanbul has a lot to offer in terms of culture, history, and cuisine.
You can visit famous landmarks like the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, explore the Grand
Bazaar and other markets, and try other Turkish specialties like kebabs, Turkish delight, and
Turkish coffee. Overall, Istanbul is a great destination for baklava lovers and anyone looking to
experience the vibrant culture and history of Turkey.
